<h1>Volleyball</h1>

<p>Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net.  Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.  It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964.  It was first played in 1895 in Holyoke, Massachusetts in the US.<i></p>
<p>Volleyball was invented by William Geroge Morgan. He was born in Lockport, New York, US. Volleyball was called ,,Mitonette'', a name derived from the game of badminton, but it was changed later to volleyball to reflect the nature of the sport.  Volleyball is an indoor non-contact team sport in which two teams have three hits to pass a ball over a dividing net.</p>
